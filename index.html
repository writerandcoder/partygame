                            <h2>How to Play</h2>
                            <p>Gather the necessary materials: You'll need pens, paper, and a device (e.g. mobile,
                                tablet, or laptop) to run the game.</p>

                            <h3>Terminology:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Terms:</strong> Each round, the device generates a word called the "term."
                                    For example, if the term is "ball," you'll write down words that relate to "ball,"
                                    such as "round," "beach," and "sphere."</li>
                                <li><strong>Responses:</strong> A response is the word or sequence of words you write
                                    down that associate with the term. For instance, if the term is "Nike," your
                                    responses could be "Air Jordan," "Sport," and "Just do it."</li>
                                <li><strong>Scorekeeper:</strong> Designate a player as the scorekeeper who tallies the
                                    scores after each round and declares the winner at the end of the game.</li>
                                <li><strong>Turn Holder:</strong> Each round, a new player becomes the "Turn Holder" starting
                                    with the oldest player, then around the table in a clockwise direction. The Turn Holder's
                                    responses will be read out loud at the end of the round.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Jibe/Jibed:</strong> If your response matches the turn holder then you jibe for that response, or you have jibed on that respnse. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Terms & Responses:</h3>
                            <p>The game generates a new term each time the "New Round" button is pressed, along with the
                                type of round it will be.</p>
                            <p>The type of game determines the number of responses that can be used by the players and
                                the turn holder.</p>
                            <p>Players aim to choose responses that match the turn holder's responses, while the turn holder tries
                                to write down responses the other players will use.</p>
                            <p>A response can contain as many words as desired and can be spelled differently as long as
                                they sound the same when vocalized (e.g., "Dr Dre" vs. "Doctor Dre").</p>
                            <p>Players cannot use the term itself as their response. Additionally, they cannot repeat
                                terms from previous rounds or use words from the term it is made up of (e.g., "bounce"
                                and "bounce").</p>
                            <p>Plural and singular forms of a response can jibe (e.g., "chook" and "chooks").</p>

                            <h3>Scoring:</h3>
                            <p><img alt="Scoring" src="./jiber/scoring.png" width="100%" />
                            </p>
                            <p>The turn holder and the players who jibe with the turn holder the most in a round earn points. For
                                example, if two players jibe twice with the turn holder, they and the turn holder each score 40
                                points for two jibes. Players who jibed only once in that round did not receive any
                                points.</p>
                            <p><b>Scoring depends on the type of round:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Double Points:</strong> In this round, players and the turn holder who have the
                                    most jibes score double points.</li>
                                <li><strong>Triple Points:</strong> Similar to the Double Points round, but scores are
                                    tripled.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bullseye:</strong> The scores of all players who jibe and the turn holder are
                                    added up collectively, and each player who jibed and the turn holder receives that
                                    cumulative score.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If there are no jibes in a round, the turn holder loses 50 points. Players cannot go into
                                negative points (e.g., if a player is on 40 points and loses 50 points, they go back to

                            <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The game requires three or more players.</li>
                                <li>The oldest player starts as the turn holder.</li>
                                <li>The turn holder controls the device and passes it around. Alternatively, one player can
                                    control the device throughout the game (better for larger devices like a laptop).
                                </li>
                                <li>The controller of the device initiates the game by pressing the "New Round" button.
                                    The device will give you your term, tell you when to start, and tell you when the
                                    round is completed.</li>
                                <li>Players begin writing their responses only after being audibly prompted by the
                                    device.</li>
                                <li>The round ends when everyone is prompted to put down their pens.</li>
                                <li>The turn holder reads out their responses at the end of the round. And players signal if
                                    they jibed on a response. Then the scorekeeper totals the scores of the turn holder and
                                    the player/s who jibed most.</li>
                                <li>After each round, the turn holder passes the device to the player sitting to their right,
                                    becoming the new turn holder.</li>
                                <li>Each player starts with zero points.</li>
                                <li>The game ends after a designated number of times around the table with a minimum of
                                    one go around the table so everyone gets a turn at being the turn holder.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <p>In a drinking game variant, players take a sip for every time they don't jibe in a
                                    round. This rule applies to both players and turn holders.</p>
                                <p>Players take an extra sip if they do not jibe in a round at all. This includes a
                                    bullseye round where if a player does not jibe, they take two sips. If a turn holder
                                    doesn't score on his round, he must finish his or her drink.</p>

                                <h3>üéÑ Kris Kringle Rules:</h3>
                                <p>The number of presents should match the number of players. At the start of the game,
                                    the presents are set aside. Each player can only possess one present at a time.
                                    Whenever the turn holder scores, they can select a present. If they already have a
                                    present, they can choose to keep it or swap it for another player's present or an
                                    unclaimed present.</p>
                                <p>If the turn holder scores 50 points or more in any round, they can choose one of four
                                    actions:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Swap two other players' presents with each other.</li>
                                    <li>Swap their own present with another player's present.</li>
                                    <li>Give an unclaimed present to another player or themselves.</li>
                                    <li>Open their own present (this does not mean they own it; it remains in the game).
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>After the game ends, the winner can choose to keep their present or swap it with
                                    another player's present. They can also swap two other players' presents.</p>
                                <p>If there are multiple winners, each winner has the right to refuse the removal of the
                                    present they have chosen.</p>
                                <p>The player(s) who come in second also have the right to refuse their present but have
                                    no swapping power.</p>
                                <p>The player(s) who come second to last at the end of the game must either do the
                                    dishes or buy pizza.</p>
